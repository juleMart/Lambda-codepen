<p>I am from New York. Working in the New York education system, first as an assistant teacher and then; as a substitute teacher. It has taught me a lot of tricks to make learning for you easier and more fun. In my website, I am bringing to you educational tools. Such as slide show courses, worksheets and one to one private teaching lessons. (www.leidyslanguages.com) </p>
